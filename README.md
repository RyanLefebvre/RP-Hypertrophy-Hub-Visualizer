## RP-Hypertrophy-Hub-Visualizer
The Renaissance Periodization Hypertophy Training Guide Central Hub is a useful tool for determining training volume if someone does not know where to start. The hub has articles that break down recommended training volumes by muscle group using the Renaissance Periodization (RP) training volume landmarks concept. The hub contains in-depth information about optimal volume, frequency, example programs and suggested exercises. The idea is that using the RP volume landmarks concepts and the guides given in the hub an individual will be able to work towards constructing a training program that meets their individual needs. The recommendations by muscle group are intended to be reasonable starting points. It is up to the individual to then adjust their training volume to build the program that is best for them. 

If you're not familiar with the volume landmarks, read this https://renaissanceperiodization.com/training-volume-landmarks-muscle-growth/, otherwise this tool wont make sense. 
Also here is a link to the Hypertophy Training Guide Central Hub https://renaissanceperiodization.com/hypertrophy-training-guide-central-hub/ that I used to build this project, it is much more thorough than the summary this tool provides.

## Motivation
I made this page to summarize the Renaissance Periodization (RP) hypertrophy training volume recommendations. I'll refer people to their hypertrophy training hub pretty often if they don't know how much volume they should be doing in the gym because I think the recommendations are reasonable starting points and RP puts out a lot of good information. One thing I'll always hear back is that people wish there was a table of all the volume landmarks in one spot.

That is what inspired me to make an easier way to visualize the landmarks by muscle group myself. I want to make it clear that I am not affiliated with RP and take no credit for their work.
